/*
 * The reducer takes care of our data
 * Using actions, we can change our application state
 * To add a new action, add it to the switch statement in the homeReducer function
 *
 * Example:
 * case YOUR_ACTION_CONSTANT:
 *   return assign({}, state, {
 *       stateVariable: action.var
 *   });
 *
 * To add a new reducer, add a file like this to the reducers folder, and
 * add it in the rootReducer.js.
