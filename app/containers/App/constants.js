/*
 * AppConstants
 * Each action has a corresponding type, which the reducer knows and picks up on.
 * To avoid weird typos between the reducer and the actions, we save them as
 * constants here.
 *
 * Follow this format:
 * export const YOUR_ACTION_CONSTANT = 'yourapp/YourContainer/YOUR_ACTION_CONSTANT';
