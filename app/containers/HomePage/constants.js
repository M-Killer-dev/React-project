/*
 * AppConstants
 * These are the variables that determine what our central data store (reducer.js)
 * changes in our state. When you add a new action, you have to add a new constant here
 *
 * Follow this format:
 * export const YOUR_ACTION_CONSTANT = 'projectName/componentName/YOUR_ACTION_CONSTANT';
 *
 * The constants are prefixed so there cannot be overlap between constants in different reducers/components
