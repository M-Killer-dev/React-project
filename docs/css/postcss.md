# PostCSS

## Why?

## How?

## Which plugins?

This boilerplate includes a few plugins by default:

* `postcss-import`: Inlines `@import`ed stylesheets to create one big stylesheet.

* `postcss-simple-vars`: Makes it possible to use `$variables in your CSS.

* `postcss-focus`: Adds a `:focus` selector to every `:hover`.

* `autoprefixer-core`: Prefixes your CSS automatically, supporting the last two versions of all major browsers and IE 8 and up.

* `cssnano`: Optimizes your CSS file. For a full list of optimizations check [the offical website](http://cssnano.co/optimisations/).

* `postcss-reporter`: Makes warnings by the above plugins visible in the console.

For a full, searchable catalog of plugins go to [postcss.parts](http://postcss.parts).
