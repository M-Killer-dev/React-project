# `sanitize.css`

Sanitize.css styles browsers to render elements more consistently with developer expectations and preferences. In comparison to that, `normalize.css` styles browsers to render elements more consistently with each other and `reset.css` unstyles every element. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages, but I prefer `sanitize.css`. See the [official documentation](https://github.com/10up/sanitize.css) for more information.

## Remove `sanitize.css`

Delete [lines 44 and 45 in `app.js`](../../app/app.js#L44-L45) and remove it from the `dependencies` in [`package.json`](../../package.json)!
