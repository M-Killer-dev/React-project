These are some things to be aware of when using this boilerplate.

## Images in the HTML file(s)

Adding images to the HTML is a bit of a pain right now as webpack only goes through the JavaScript file. Add the image to your HTML file how you always would:

```HTML
<!-- Normal Image -->
<img src="img/yourimg.png" />
<!-- Meta tags -->
<meta property="og:image" content="img/yourimg.png" />
<!-- ... -->
```

If you simply do this, webpack will not transfer the images to the build folder. To get webpack to transfer them, you have to import them with the file loader in your JavaScript somewhere, e.g.:

```JavaScript
import 'file?name=[name].[ext]!../img/yourimg.png';
```

Then webpack will correctly transfer the image to the build folder.
