# PostCSS

PostCSS is a modular CSS preprocessor based on JavaScript. See the [official documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for more information!

## Plugins

This boilerplate includes a few PostCSS plugins by default:

* [`postcss-focus`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-focus): Adds a `:focus` selector to every `:hover` selector for keyboard accessibility.

* [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer): Prefixes your CSS automatically for the last two versions of all major browsers and IE10+.

* [`cssnext`](https://github.com/moox/postcss-cssnext): Use tomorrows CSS features today. Transpiles CSS4 features down to CSS3.

* [`cssnano`](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano): Optimizes your CSS file. For a full list of optimizations check [the offical website](http://cssnano.co/optimisations/).
