# Getting started

> Note: You'll need Node, npm and git installed for this to work â€“ if you don't have them installed, have never heard of them or one of those steps throws an "Unknown command" error, go to the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) first!

1. Clone this repo using `git clone git@github.com:mxstbr/react-boilerplate`.

2. Run `npm run initProject` to initialize a new project.

3. Run `npm start` to start the local web server.

Now you can go to `http://localhost:3000` and see your app!
