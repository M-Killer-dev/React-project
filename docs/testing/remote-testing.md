# Testing from different locations

```Shell
$ npm run serve
```

This command will start a server and tunnel it through with `ngrok`. This'll give you a URL that looks a bit like this: `xxxxx.ngrok.com` This URL will show the version of your application that's in the `build` folder, and is accessible from the entire world! This is great for testing on different devices from different locations!
